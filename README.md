- 👋 Hi, I’m @sjfisher7
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Tech. Learning something new every single day.
-  Completed my Certificate in Cybersecurity from KU Bootcamp. I am COMPTIA Security + certified. 
Finally found me a nice Help Desk Job to start out in, trying to branch out a little and see what area interestes me the most.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me in the IT industry get a job. I am seeking information about learning Python and more about VMs's.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
The best way to reach me is through my email, sarah.fisher7@gmail.com. I check it more than anything else.

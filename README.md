- 👋 Hi, I’m @sjfisher7
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Tech. Learning something new every single day.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on Coursera Technical Support Fundamental by Google. I take my COMPTIA Security + certification test soon. 
I already have a Cybersecurity Certificate from KU, trying to branch out a little and see what area interestes me the most.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me in the IT industry get a job. I am seeking information about learning Python and more about VMs's.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
The best way to reach me is through my email, sarah.fisher7@gmail.com. I check it more than anything else.
